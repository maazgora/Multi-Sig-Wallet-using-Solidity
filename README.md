# Multi-Sig-Wallet-using-Solidity

In the realm of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), securing digital assets is paramount. A significant challenge is ensuring that funds are not easily compromised by a single point of failure, such as a single private key holder. Multi-signature wallets offer a solution by requiring multiple parties to approve transactions before they are executed, thereby enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

# Objectives
Develop a robust and secure multi-signature wallet using Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. The wallet should support the following key functionalities:

Allow multiple owners to be added at the time of contract deployment.
Require a specified number of confirmations from the owners to approve a transaction.
Enable owners to submit, confirm, and execute transactions.
Provide transparency and accountability by tracking which owners have confirmed each transaction.
